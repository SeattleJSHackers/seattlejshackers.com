### Welcome!

**Seattle JS Hackers** is an open and inclusive after-hours community of JavaScript hackers who learn and hack in JavaScript together. We are entrepreneurs, creatives, professionals, tinkerers, computer scientists, educators, marketers, and more -- all working to ignite and amplify our personal productivity and collaboration.

**How we do it:** We organize hacking sessions at WiFi-ready offices, cafes and bars around Seattle each week. Our hacking sessions encourage peer ideation and review, knowledge sharing, new champions for causes and projects, personal productivity, and a heightened sense of community.
